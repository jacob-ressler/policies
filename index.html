			<h1>Privacy Policies</h1>
			<p>
				Oh hi there :) Upon checking my Google Play developer console for the first time in about 2
				years, it has come to my attention that I should probably have a privacy policy for my game
				Chaturanga. Definitely something I came up with and not something Google yelled at me
				about... Well anyway, here you will be able to find all my very unprofessional privacy
				policies for any personal projects that require them.
